### What I learned

I had to work more with box-shadows for this project, which was good practice. The toughest part of it for me was matching the color. None of the colors in the style guide, seemed right, so in the end I used a color picker to grab the color from the sample image. It still didn't look quite right, but I'm not sure what I could have done to make it closer.

After finishing the mobile view for this project, I was intimidated by creating the desktop layout. It turned out to be pretty simple to figure out in the end. It showed me some more of what flexbox is capable of.

I started using variables for the first time for this project. It was definitely easier than going back to the style guide and referencing the colors over and over again. I also worked on using fewer classes and using more specific CSS selectors so that my HTML was less messy. It was a bit more difficult since I'm used to giving elements names that are easy for me to remember while working on CSS, but I think I can get used to it.

### Continued development

I want to continue working on responsive design and more advanced layouts. I barely know how to use grid, so I need to work on that more as well. I'm going to continue using variables and working on using fewer classes where they aren't necessary. All in all, I'm quite proud of this project.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp) - This article helped me review how to declare variables.
- [Resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - I used this article to review box-shadow properties, since they're difficult for me to remember.
- [Resource 3](https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/ntulibrary/2018/09/12/how-to-align-images-on-your-website/) - I read this article to figure out how to align my icons to the right side of the card.
